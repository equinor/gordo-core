gordo-core
==========

gordo-core can fetch data from various sources, including databases, APIs, and file systems. The library provides a unified interface for accessing these data sources, making integrating new sources into the workflow easy.
It also provides tools for preprocessing and cleaning fetched data.

Example of usage:

.. ipython::
    :okwarning:

    In [1]: from gordo_core.time_series import RandomDataset

    In [2]: dataset = RandomDataset(
       ...:     train_start_date='2023-01-01 00:00:00+00:00',
       ...:     train_end_date='2023-01-31 00:00:00+00:00',
       ...:     tag_list=['tag1', 'tag2', 'tag3']
       ...: )

    In [3]: X, y = dataset.get_data()  # Randomly generated X, y dataframes

    In [4]: X
